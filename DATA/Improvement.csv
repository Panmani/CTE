367,"In fact I prefer the use of Panopto more than Zoom. This is because in Zoom the discussion is more dependent on the internet connection of individual users. If the connection is not stable, the discussion will be disturbed and would probably lead to delay of the class. The speech of the individual user is also interrupted when the connection is not stable, which makes his/her speech unclear. As for the use of the chat-box for presentation, it is actually quite difficult to respond verbally while paying attention to the constantly updating chat room. Thus it would be better to simply keep everything either verbal or written in the chatroom instead of both.  Although Panopto lacks the interaction among the class, the speaker's speech is less likely to be interrupted by the connection. Thus the comprehension of the contents would be clearer. Another important benefit of Panopto is that the participants of the class are not forced to sit through the whole lesson as in zoom. They can  better adjust their time to complete the class and also review the class when needed. Thus I believe for a difficult course like this one, Panopto maybe a better choice as students can have a chance to review it over and over again in Panopto to understand the content. They can also stop for some online searching or reference of the reading when they have questions, instead of holding the questions or misconceptions while continuing class.",s,y,,,s y  ,network connection,another software,,,S Y  ,"IT-related, Choice of platform","network connection, another software",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,network connection,,another software,,

Unlike professors can track students' progress via in-class exercises/quizzes or students can ask questions, I do not think professors can assess the learning of students through Zoom classes. I usually resort to Google or e-books to understand the class materials, which somehow makes me find online classes quite unnecessary. 3. Lower the difficulty of open-book exams and assignments, which is now unreasonable. Because of open-book exams, lecturers tend to design more difficult questions and request us to finish the exam in a very short period of time. (Yet professors always forget that students do face technical issues since typing, downloading and uploading take time!)

For instance, in Muslim country, there is a custom and habit where the Muslim people will have their praying in speaker and played 5 times in a day. It is maybe not relatable in Hong Kong, but it happens to those who came from these countries. Maybe to prevent the students from not attending the real online lecture, you can provide the recorded material 10 days before the final exam instead of posting it weekly.

1463,"I believe that the amount of workload is way too much as we're expected to submit something almost every week to the blackboard's discussion board, and what's more frustrating is that we don't even know why we're doing that/if our work is being graded, because most submissions aren't specified in the course assessment scheme. In a way I feel forced to submit the courseworks (the instructor called students out by name in the course's whatsapp group chat if we didn't submit our work/respond to his messages when he asked for inputs), especially the impromptu works we need to submit to the discussion board, as we've talked about what we had to submit during the class, so I feel like it's just double the work and a waste of time. I also feel that the instructor wasn't flexible enough, given the whole COVID situation, and has very high expectations from students taking this course. For an assignment, we had to conduct our own field trip and make a report about it. Considering the COVID has become a worldwide pandemic, it is very dangerous to go outside and we've tried voicing our concerns to the instructor. At first he insisted that we should still do the field trip, even if it's around our house. The reality is, students' conditions are different. What works for one student may not work for another. In this case, my situation doesn't allow me to conduct any activities outdoor without jeopardising my and my family's health, which I believe is more important than a coursework. Thankfully the instructor finally understood and agreed that we should submit a research-based paper instead.  I get that he's very passionate and he means good for students, but I believe his assessment methods are inappropriate. For instance, for the quiz, we're told to work in groups and our grades are based on how fast we submit the quiz. The instructor later said that the first group to submit will get A, the second will get A-, third will get B+, fourth will get B, fifth will get B-, etc. I honestly don't understand his reasoning behind this grading scheme and what he wishes to get from this. If his intention is to encourage us to gain more knowledge and work faster, surely there's better ways to encourage that. Throughout my university life, this is the first time I've encountered such ambitious / uneasy environment where learning becomes very stressful. What I expected to be an insightful and fun learning environment from the field trips and discussions turned out to be a very stressful, demanding course. Additionally, the instructor never released any of our coursework's grades so it just adds to the disappointment because I have no idea how I'm doing so far in the course, and when I asked him about this he only told me to be patient as he's working on the grading.  I'd appreciate more understanding, flexibility, and transparency from the course instructor for the assessment scheme and grading, and I hope that moving forward, the course is more well organised.",p,M,r,,p M r ,assessment,workload,lecturer,,P M R ,"Assignment, On intructor, Assessment","workload, lecturer, assessment",,,,,,,,,,workload,,,,,,,,lecturer,assessment,,,,,

1465,我認為本科老師 Mr. JOR Chi Keung 是熱心的環保人士，亦十分欣賞他想傳達的環保訊息，例如塑膠如何污染地球，又需要多少時間分解，與和聲書院的理念十分切合。 但是，我認為他的教學方式有很大改善空間，有以下原因。 １。他沒有完全跟從課程大綱去教學，而且經常增加額外工作量。 例如，有一堂他叫我們分組討論新冠肺炎疫情，然後向全體同學介紹討論了什麼，而最後每一組都要另外寫一份報告。 又或者，他於blackboard的discussion board分享他製作DIY口罩的教學，然後叫同學寫一篇反思或感想。（儘管他聲稱是Make-up assignment） 而課程大綱清楚寫明只有3份寫作功課，並不包括以上兩者；更重要的是，我認為他可以分享自己DIY口罩教學，但不代表同學需要為此額外撰寫文章。他似乎並不了解每個同學都有一定程度的功課負擔。 ２。我認為他未有作出足夠努力去應付網上教學。 他基本上沒有準備PowerPoint，雖然我認為這並非必要，但很多時候他只是在播放影片或叫我們閱讀文章。然後，讓我們在breakout rooms作一小時討論（順帶一提，他開breakout rooms要用30-40分鐘）。最後，讓同學發表意見，又佔了一個小時。我認為，他對生物、環境學識不淺，但課堂上至少一半時間，他只是叫學生討論、表達意見，而非教導專業知識。 我明白網上教學有難處，而有兩個Field trip亦取消了，但他作為老師，我們付出學費，是希望從老師身上學習知識，而非不斷與同學討論、分享意見，他亦有責任應付網上教學的挑戰。至少我認為此教學方式是不合理的。 ３。他上課偏向講授鳥類知識。 他是一個喜歡雀鳥的人，我因此對鳥類有所了解。但是，他將不少時間放在講授雀鳥身上。比如，三篇寫作功課中有一篇就是講雀鳥的；然後，他有一堂是教如何分辨雀鳥，並設有online quiz。他於上堂前把一幅百鳥圖傳給我們，叫我們溫習，然後quiz內容就是分辨25種雀鳥，並寫出每一種的名稱，最快的可以有A，第二組A-，如此類推。他身為專業人士當然輕易分得出，但對我們來說很困難，而我亦看不出這個quiz的意義何在，鬥快分得出雀鳥品種代表什麼，為何會是考核內容？而且，自然界其他成員，例如植物（在課程大綱寫著有一堂教植物，但被略過了），他基本上很少教導有關知識。 ４。他播放一段大陸電視台報導假魚翅的影響，但問題是全中文的。 儘管班上不少留學生，他只是叫他們找一個Chinese partner去翻譯給他們聽，不太合理。如果作為教材，他至少要加上英文字幕。 另外還有一些問題，例如有香港同學被分進一個3個印尼人的小組中，但老師要他們一起合作完成實地考察報告。問題是，他們印尼人早已完成實地考察，為何要與一個香港學生一起完成報告？當然他最後被無視。本科老師 Mr. JOR Chi Keung對處理學生的功課事情上不夠敏銳。 我明白疫情之下，本科老師 Mr. JOR Chi Keung 可能未能適應網上教學，我亦體諒他一些電腦技術上的問題。但是，他作為老師，有責任去應付挑戰，而我不認為他太熱心於網上教學，只是不斷讓我們看文章、影片，然後不斷討論，作自我反思。甚至最後兩堂，都是同學的presentation，而他將之稱為lesson，我想他對lesson的定義與同學有些不同。以我四年上堂經驗為參考，我想大部份課堂，應該是學生從老師身上學習專業知識，而不是不斷被迫發表小組討論的內容、個人感想，或是同學之間一直互相交流意見，這學到的並不會太多。 如果沒有疫情，可能以上問題不會那麼嚴重，或甚至沒有這些問題。但假若，下學期仍然是疫情持續，我認為本課程極需要作出改善。,r,,,,r   ,lecturer - well done,,,,R   ,On intructor,lecturer - well done,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,lecturer - well done,,,,,,

1467,"本人對於此課程的看法以及建議甚為冗長，敬請參閱的職員認真閱讀，萬分感謝！ 本科的重點之處就是外出實地考察，若然改為全網上學習則失去了本來的精妙之處。 同時，或許因為採用網上教學的方法，本科的負責老師佐志強先生採用了惡劣的教學風格以及奇怪的方針，如教學內容與Course Outline中所寫的內容極不符合，例如曾經提及會教授植物相關的知識，在課程的中斷及後段卻只集中討論近日的肺炎疫情，嚴重地使本科學習失焦。 此外，由於使用了網上的教學平台，在每一次上課的時候，教授的老師佐志強先生也用盡上課的時間於開啟討論房間，有些時候花費了1小時也未能成功把同學分組，而大多課堂的內容也只有多於一個小時的討論，極度欠缺深度，並且欠缺老師預備的教學內容，使學習的成效極其低下，亦可見部份教學人員未能夠有效掌握以網上平台教學的技巧，本人對此深表遺憾。 同一時間，由於只是使用網上平台，加上負責導師的獨特教學風格，佐志強先生經常隨機的要求同學撰寫不少於500字的文章，而這些額外的功課以及作業並沒有在課程大綱中清楚列明，而老師亦沒有提供足夠教學內容以及引導以幫助學生完成作業要求，例如，老師只提供了一個Micro-Module, 則要求學生自我搜尋資料以及學習並完成一篇不少於500字及有關雀鳥羽毛的文章，同事亦要求學生使用多於七成的時間在堂上自由討論，可見導師根本沒有認真教授過任何內容。 同時，在網上測驗方面，由於導師欠缺使用網上平台的經驗，又決定在網上進行測驗，因此測驗的難度極高以及質量極其低劣，開始測驗名為雀鳥測驗，在測驗中需要在極短時間內準確辨認25種在香港內常見的雀鳥，可是，佐先生卻在事前提供了一段只有4分鐘的影片，以及幾張低清的照片，便草草的表示已經提供了所有測驗所需要用到的資料，並在測驗的時候已極度離譜的速度展示所有雀鳥的照片，雖然他在展示的過程中詢問了各位學生有沒有問題，但即使有人反映測驗過於困難需要幫助，他也無動於衷，繼續進行測驗，最終測驗完成，可以成功完成並獲得良好成績的人我相信寥寥可數。 總括來說，我並不認為我在這個科目能夠獲得優異的成績，或許要歸咎於我不突出的學業能力，但同時在使用網上教學的方法下，本科導師的表現極其惡劣，故此，若然我獲得差劣的成績也不足為奇，遺憾的是，我也沒能夠學到任何知識，並從此課程中獲得任何得益，我認為課程本身可以保留，但教學的老師佐志強先生絕對不適合任職此課程的教師，其惡劣的表現並不能歸咎於使用網上平台，我並不希望有人在跟我一樣報讀這個課程之後，同樣經歷這樣的事情，因此，我希望大學以及和聲書院認真考慮更換課程導師，或是永久取消這個課程，以確保和聲書院通識課程的質量。",r,L,,,r L  ,lecturer,field trips/ site visits,,,R L  ,"Learning activities, On intructor","field trips/ site visits, lecturer",,,,,,,,,field trips/ site visits,,,,,,,,,lecturer,,,,,,

3992,"The course implemented very poor online teaching measures. Main problems and suggestions are as follow:1. The lecturer is using handwritten notes in PDF format and annotates these notes using his mouse cursor in the lecture videos. This results in extremely poor readability of lecture videos where his words written are almost unrecognizable. At Week 11, he even stopped handwriting notes and annotate on textbooks(PDF format) directly, which makes the layout very messy. We complained about his handwritten notes before online teaching. However, the lecturer only made proper typed notes shortly for lectures at around week 4-6. The lecturer failed to utilize IT resources for teaching which results in very bad quality teaching. It seems that the lecturer is not listening to students and the quality of his lecture videos greatly deteriorates during the later part of the course. The lecturer should use the proper software to create electronic notes. If he insists to use handwritten notes, which is not ideal at all, he should purchase appropriate equipment such as a stylus and graphing software to ensure the basic readability of his lecture video and notes.2. The lecturer imposed inappropriate rules for online assessment. The rules are very disturbing but did not prevent cheating. During the Test, the lecturer requires everyone to use a phone filming our face and computer screen *at the same time* and live stream the video feed on ZOOM platform. The lecturer failed to realize that it is hard to do so for those who have limited space and equipment at home. I personally have a good home environment but I found following such arrangement annoying and disturbing, not to mention that I feel that my privacy has been invaded. Meanwhile, I can think of tons of ways to cheat including using mobile phones outside the coverage of the camera and calling others for help. The lecturer made a false assumption that these rules can prevent cheating which in fact is almost useless to stop those who do cheat. The lecturer should assume that such actions cannot be prevented and make appropriate changes to the assessment framework, such as changing the weighing of components and introducing individual projects which cannot be directly copied from others.",p,,,,p   ,assessment,,,,P   ,Assessment,assessment,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,assessment,,,,,

4218,"I think it is harder for us to really communicate effectively so there were a lot of miscommunications and it is very frustrating. Also, Agnes would always ask us one by one on our story progress and I understand we sort of have to know what our classmates are doing, but it does waste quite some time that could be used to talk to the editors or partners about how to polish the work. I would really rather be put in a breakout room and just talk about all those little details of the story with editors like what we used to do in school. And Agnes wants us to jot notes because she says it can train our note-taking skills and she really needs to know whether we are there the entire class. For the part of training note-taking skills, I am sceptical about it. I believe Agnes herself also thinks it is pretty different between writing and typing. So when it is only typing what others say, I feel like I am a machine and I don't really have to process anything before typing the words in a document. And the content of the notes we jot in class and in interviews are pretty different. Former is just story progress that you can't really get a key point from it but the latter allows you to distinguish which line is important and worth jotting. Don't get me wrong that I am just having an excuse to be lazy. I love jotting notes that everyone knows me in class asks me what I wrote on the notebook. But I really don't find the meaning of being like a secretary to jot down the process of my fellow reporters. Frankly, I learn nothing from it. I know teachers have the worries that we are not listening. But you can ask us to write a reflection after each class or just keep asking questions so you can make sure we are all there. It really doesn't have to be notes taking. And I think the online multimedia workshops were not as good as the ones in school. We didn't have the software at that time and we wasted a lot of time to just download the materials and I don't think I would know how to do it now because it is not really put into practice.",g,h,r,u,g h r u,communication,breakout room,lecturer,Learning result and effectiveness,G H R U,"Course, Interaction, Discussion/ Group work, On intructor","Learning result and effectiveness, communication, breakout room, lecturer",,,,,,,,Learning result and effectiveness,,,communication,breakout room,,,,,,lecturer,,,,,,

Yet, when I got back my grade for this assessment, the professor put this issue down on the comment of ""Delivery"".

I have also heard from other students saying that he put a remark saying that there was cluttering during the presentation. However, that was not cluttering but the poor internet connection.

When this assessment was held online, naturally students would look at their classmates' faces on their computer screen, but the device camera would not capture that they were looking at each other, but rather looking away from the camera. It does not make sense to still have eye contact as one of the marking criteria. The environments which students were in during the meeting assessment hindered their body movements. Also, disturbance and distractions in the home environment of each participant piled up and affected the smooth running of the meeting. Along with other limitations, it is unfair to still implement the assessment with original guidelines and marking criteria.Moreover, the group report (final assignment of the course) is also not as feasible now that online teaching is in place. Students have to form their own groups online during lecture hours on Zoom, which can result in delayed communication and difficulty for some students to form group effectively.

Unlike  during physical lectures when I only compare teaching between professors, now I compare my online classes with the ones offered by other institutions (e.g. udemy, coursea, youtube). CUHK online classes are not engaging, inspiring and well paced compared to the alternatives since our school, departments and teachers are not well prepared. 2. Increase support to students, which now is very limited. Unlike professors can track students' progress via in-class exercises/quizzes or students can ask questions, I do not think professors can assess the learning of students through Zoom classes. I usually resort to Google or e-books to understand the class materials, which somehow makes me find online classes quite unnecessary.3. Lower the difficulty of open-book exams and assignments, which is now unreasonable. Because of open-book exams, lecturers tend to design more difficult questions and request us to finish the exam in a very short period of time. (Yet professors always forget that students do face technical issues since typing, downloading and uploading take time!) However, in lectures, teachers tend to ask simple questions in Zoom class with poll/ raising hands and use simple examples, which lead to a more serious gap between what is taught in class and what is examined.",p,g,,,p g  ,difficulty,interaction,,,P G  ,"Interaction, Assessment","interaction, difficulty",,,,,,,,,,,interaction,,,,,,,,difficulty,,,,,

5756,"1. Making the online lectures more engaging. Now it is like watching boring educational videos on Youtube. Unlike  during physical lectures when I only compare teaching between professors, now I compare my online classes with the ones offered by other institutions (e.g. udemy, coursea, youtube). CUHK online classes are not engaging, inspiring and well paced compared to the alternatives since our school, departments and teachers are not well prepared.  2. Increase support to students, which now is very limited. Unlike professors can track students' progress via in-class exercises/quizzes or students can ask questions, I do not think professors can assess the learning of students through Zoom classes. I usually resort to Google or e-books to understand the class materials, which somehow makes me find online classes quite unnecessary. 3. Lower the difficulty of open-book exams and assignments, which is now unreasonable. Because of open-book exams, lecturers tend to design more difficult questions and request us to finish the exam in a very short period of time. (Yet professors always forget that students do face technical issues since typing, downloading and uploading take time!) However, in lectures, teachers tend to ask simple questions in Zoom class with poll/ raising hands and use simple examples, which lead to a more serious gap between what is taught in class and what is examined.",p,g,,,p g  ,difficulty,interaction,,,P G  ,"Interaction, Assessment","interaction, difficulty",,,,,,,,,,,interaction,,,,,,,,difficulty,,,,,

The professor barely explain in-depth concepts and often perform calculation, and the style of presenting the powerpoint is reading is directly in a monotone manner.

Now it is like watching boring educational videos on Youtube, since our lecturers and professors are not professional Youtubers and  the videos are not engaging at all. 2. Increase support to students, which now is very limited. Unlike professors can track students' progress via in-class exercises/quizzes or students can ask questions, I do not think professors can assess the learning of students through Zoom classes. I usually resort to Google or e-books to understand the class materials, which somehow makes me find online classes quite unnecessary.3. Lower the difficulty of open-book exams and assignments, which is now unreasonable. Because of open-book exams, lecturers tend to design more difficult questions and request us to finish the exam in a very short period of time. (Yet professors always forget that students do face technical issues since typing, downloading and uploading take time!)

Although the form of assessment was changed, I think the professor could have let us know the pros and cons of having certain assessments. DiscussionIf there’s any discussion session during the online learning, materials should be uploaded to blackboard a few days in advanced. It’s a bit difficult to read and then discuss with the classmates. As some of the terms are very technical (that’s about Covid-19 assessment), the preparation might be needed and it would also be great that we read before lesson.

I would also like to put forward one thing that could perhaps, in m view, be improved. Well, I think the pace of this course is a little bit fast. When we finished the Linear Algebra part of the course and move on to the Advanced Algebra and other topics related, many concepts are new to us and I don't feel that we have be given adequate background information about them, making it really hard to follow. I understand it is a ELITE course and requires more effort. But it would be better if we focus more on the Linear Algebra part of the course, and explain it in more detail and deeper. I personally like the other topics and projects very much, and the outline is apparently very well designed by professor and very interesting. I just feel it could be better if we can be given more ""beginner"" information about some topics since many of us have never touched these topics before and there is only one week for us to get familiar with each of them. But in conclusion, I would really like to thank Prof. Jaggi for giving us this very precious opportunity to learn so many interesting topics and giving us valuable advice in many aspects.

8180,"there are many big problems regarding the commercial law course: 1/ we had one teacher (Ian Lee) but 60% of the exam was graded by another teacher that we NEVER had (Suresh Kilani). This is not normal. The class of Ian Lee is deeply penalised by this very poor arrangement. How the faculty will remedy the students who did not have Suresh ? this is such a common sense remark, I even raised it very early in term 2 but the answer I received from the faculty was absolutely NOT satisfactory. I am deeply dissatisfied with this arrangement. When a class is taught by a teacher, that teacher must grade us, plain and simple ! Any other arrangement is absurd. I find it very strange that the faculty actually allowed this class arrangement in the first place. As a school you should have the education of the students as a first priority. This poor arrangement was not conducive at all to a good learning experience.  2/ the online assessment software is a disaster. How can you seriously expect the students to perform well when we cannot even print the questions ?? You may not realise how penalising this is, but when the exam questions is a long case situation with many facts and names we MUST be able to print it, it's absolutely impossible to perform well by scrolling up and down hundreds of time. We are wasting at least 20 min just by doing that, out of the 3 hours of the exam. Again a huge misjudgment from your part.  3/ I have a last remark regarding the way commercial law is taught, particularly for the security question. This is a substantive remark, not procedural (unlike my points #1 and #2 above). When a teacher teaches he must give us tutorial so as to prepare us for the exam, right ? Suresh does not. The security tutorial we had was so different from what we had in the exam that succeeding the tutorial meant in no way whether we could do well in the exam. This is a very serious problem, because even students who work hard and do well in tutorials are not equipped to succeed in the exam. In addition, we didn't have any tutorial for the last week's topic but it was still in the examinable subject.  In conclusion, because of points #1, #2 and #3 above, students cannot do well. This is NOT because of a lack of work on our side, this is due to poor class arrangement, disastrous software and, more importantly, a substantive problem with Suresh's way of teaching.

Prof covers each section of class quite differently. Some section(s) explains materials clearer with more details for certain PPT slides but not others. I had to listen to two out of three sections of each lecture to ensure that I can capture a fuller set of notes.

I hope the Faculty and other profs could adopt a similar approach like this course for the assessment- allowing students more time (like 7 days or more) to revisit the course materials and do research to complete the assignments / exam paper. This is very vital for part time students as we could only do the paper after work. Hopefully the Faculty could consider launching more courses for take-home assignments.

I believe if this course does the same, most students are willing to cooperate as well, if they take this course out of interest.Also, I believe the assessments should be conducted live in class instead of private video submission.

Most of the other professors, they join the Zoom meeting 10 minutes earlier than the class. Also, Miss. Lok does not check her email box often. It took about few days to get reply back from her. Moreover, she delayed class too often. I can understand she had some health issues including having symptoms of COVID-19 after coming back from Japan. However, delaying the class more than 3 weeks seems like she is not into our course. Lastly, me and other classmates found that she were playing the previously recorded class videos during the class. She did not used these videos as a supplimentary study material but as the entire class materials. I was very shocked and disappointed when I found this. I do respect her, but even I can teach our class with her teaching methods. Only I have to do is late 10 minutes later than the Strat time, turn on recorded videos, and delay classes whenever I am sick. Many students are not satisfied with the decision made by the university about non-discounted tuition fee. The reasoning for the university is that they are confident with the current online teaching method, since it is providing same quality of education as offline class.
